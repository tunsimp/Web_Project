<h1>Introduction to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h1>

<div class="definition-box">
  <h2>What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?</h2>
  <p>
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a client-side code injection attack where
    attackers inject malicious scripts into otherwise benign and trusted
    websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send
    malicious code, generally in the form of a browser script, to a different
    end user.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>How XSS Works</h2>
<p>XSS vulnerabilities occur when web applications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Take user input and incorporate it into page responses
    <strong>without proper validation or encoding</strong>
  </li>
  <li>Accept and execute untrusted data as part of HTML code</li>
  <li>
    Use JavaScript to dynamically create HTML content from user-controlled
    sources
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="example-box">
  <h3>Simple Example:</h3>
  <p>A search form that displays "You searched for: &lt;user input&gt;"</p>
  <p>If the input is: <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
  <p>The result could execute the JavaScript code, showing an alert box</p>
</div>

<h2>Impact of XSS Attacks</h2>
<p>If successful, an XSS attack can allow the attacker to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Steal session cookies and hijack user accounts</li>
  <li>Capture keystrokes and steal sensitive data</li>
  <li>Deface websites or insert unwanted content</li>
  <li>Redirect users to malicious websites</li>
  <li>Perform actions on behalf of the victim</li>
</ul>

<div class="danger-box">
  <h3>Security Risk</h3>
  <p>
    XSS attacks bypass the Same Origin Policy (SOP), which is designed to
    prevent scripts from one site accessing data from another site. This makes
    XSS particularly dangerous as it executes with the privileges of the
    vulnerable application.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Types of XSS</h2>
<p>XSS attacks are classified into three main categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Reflected XSS</strong> - Malicious script comes from the current
    HTTP request
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stored XSS</strong> - Malicious script comes from the website's
    database
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>DOM-based XSS</strong> - Vulnerability exists in client-side code
    rather than server-side code
  </li>
</ol>
<p>We'll explore each type in detail in the following slides.</p>
