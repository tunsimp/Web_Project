<h1>Introduction to SQL Injection</h1>

<div class="definition-box">
  <h2>What is SQL Injection?</h2>
  <p>
    SQL Injection (SQLi) is a code injection technique that exploits
    vulnerabilities in web applications that use SQL databases. Attackers insert
    malicious SQL statements into entry fields, which are then executed by the
    application's database. This attack vector allows attackers to access,
    modify, or delete data, bypass authentication, and in some cases, gain
    complete control over the database server.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>How SQL Injection Works</h2>
<p>SQL Injection attacks occur when applications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Build SQL queries by concatenating strings that include user-supplied input
    <strong>without proper validation or parameterization</strong>
  </li>
  <li>Trust user input and incorporate it directly into SQL queries</li>
  <li>Fail to implement proper escaping or sanitization of user data</li>
</ul>

<div class="example-box">
  <h3>Simple Example:</h3>
  <p>Consider a login query built using string concatenation:</p>
  <p>
    <code
      >sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND
      password = '" + password + "';"</code
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    If a user enters the following as their username: <code>admin' --</code>
  </p>
  <p>The resulting query becomes:</p>
  <p>
    <code
      >SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password =
      'anything';</code
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>--</code> is a comment in SQL, causing the password check to be
    ignored, allowing access with any password.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Impact of SQL Injection</h2>
<p>If successful, an SQL Injection attack can allow the attacker to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access sensitive data from the database</li>
  <li>Modify database data (insert, update, delete)</li>
  <li>Execute administration operations on the database</li>
  <li>Recover the content of a given file on the database server</li>
  <li>In some cases, issue commands to the operating system</li>
  <li>Bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms</li>
</ul>

<div class="danger-box">
  <h3>Critical Security Risk</h3>
  <p>
    SQL injection has been consistently ranked as one of the top web application
    vulnerabilities in the OWASP Top 10. A successful SQL injection attack can
    have devastating consequences for an organization, including data breaches,
    regulatory fines, and severe damage to reputation.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Types of SQL Injection</h2>
<p>SQL Injection attacks are typically classified into three categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>In-band SQLi</strong> - The attacker uses the same communication
    channel to launch the attack and gather results
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Error-based</strong> - Forces the database to generate error
        messages that may reveal information
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Union-based</strong> - Uses UNION SQL operator to combine
        results of multiple SELECT statements
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Blind SQLi</strong> - No data is transferred from the database
    server to the attacker
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Boolean-based</strong> - Sends queries that make the application
        return different results based on whether the query is true or false
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Time-based</strong> - Forces the database to wait for a
        specified time before responding
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Out-of-band SQLi</strong> - Uses alternative channels to extract
    data (e.g., making DNS or HTTP requests from the database server)
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Common SQL Injection Techniques</h2>
<p>
  Attackers use various techniques to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Bypassing authentication</strong> - Using SQLi to log in without
    valid credentials
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Union attacks</strong> - Combining result sets from different
    queries
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Extracting data</strong> - Retrieving sensitive information from the
    database
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Examining the database</strong> - Determining database structure and
    schema
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Blind SQL injection</strong> - Inferring data when direct output is
    not available
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Database fingerprinting</strong> - Identifying the underlying
    database system
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="example-box">
  <h3>UNION Attack Example:</h3>
  <p>For a product search form that directly includes user input in a query:</p>
  <p>
    <code
      >SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category =
      'Electronics'</code
    >
  </p>
  <p>An attacker might input:</p>
  <p>
    <code>Electronics' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--</code>
  </p>
  <p>Resulting in:</p>
  <p>
    <code
      >SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics'
      UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--'</code
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    This returns both product information and user credentials in a single
    response.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Real-World Consequences</h2>
<p>SQL injection attacks have led to numerous high-profile data breaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In 2008, Heartland Payment Systems suffered an SQL injection attack that
    exposed over 130 million credit card numbers
  </li>
  <li>
    In 2011, Sony PlayStation Network was breached via SQL injection, affecting
    77 million users
  </li>
  <li>
    In 2015, an SQL injection vulnerability in vBulletin software led to
    breaches of several major forums
  </li>
  <li>
    In 2017, Equifax suffered a major breach that exposed personal information
    of 147 million people
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="danger-box">
  <h3>Business Impact</h3>
  <p>
    Beyond the technical damage, SQL injection breaches often result in
    substantial financial losses through regulatory fines, lawsuits, remediation
    costs, and lost business due to reputation damage. The average cost of a
    data breach in 2023 exceeded $4.5 million per incident.

<h2>Prevention Preview</h2>
<p>
  We'll cover SQL injection prevention in detail later, but key strategies
  include:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)</strong> - Separate SQL
    code from data
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stored Procedures</strong> - Encapsulate SQL logic in the database
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Input Validation</strong> - Verify that user input meets expected
    formats
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Escaping User Input</strong> - Escape special characters in user
    input
  </li>
  <li><strong>Least Privilege</strong> - Limit database account permissions</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Web Application Firewalls</strong> - Filter malicious SQL patterns
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="example-box">
  <h3>Secure Code Example:</h3>
  <p>Instead of concatenating strings:</p>
  <p>
    <code>
      // Vulnerable code<br />
      String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'
      AND password = '" + password + "'";
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>Use parameterized queries:</p>
  <p>
    <code>
      // Secure code<br />
      PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users
      WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");<br />
      stmt.setString(1, username);<br />
      stmt.setString(2, password);<br />
      ResultSet results = stmt.executeQuery();
    </code>
  </p>
</div>
